# Specification Quality Checklist: Static Content Build Pipeline

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Frontmatter matches the shared validation contract
- [x] Required headings for the selected route are present in canonical order
- [x] Status line uses a valid lifecycle state
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed. Three candidate ambiguities raised in the original feature
  request (catalog.json vs. generated-data-file ownership split, CI/build-trigger mechanism, and whether
  System metadata also moves to Markdown) are all implementation/architecture decisions, not business-scope
  ambiguities — they are recorded under **Assumptions** and explicitly deferred to `/devspark.plan`.
- All checklist items pass on first pass. No repair iterations were required.
